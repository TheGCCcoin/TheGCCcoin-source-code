Intro
-----
Global cryptocurrency (GCC) is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/TheGCCcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/TheGCCcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 36502 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  GCC works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the GCC network.
